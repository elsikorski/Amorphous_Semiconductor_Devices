abstract = {Temperature dependences of the drift mobilities of electrons and holes are investigated in chalcogenide-glass semiconductors with composition Se 95 As 5 , both without impurities and with the impurities Ag and Br. The data obtained indicate that the localized states that control the transport of charge carriers are U-centers, and that the change in the magnitude of the drift mobility after doping is caused by a change in the concentration of these centers. Estimates of the concentrations of positive and negatively charged intrinsic defects show that their values are similar, equalling 10 16 cm 3 in impurity-free glasses with the composition Se 95 As 5 and lying in the range 10 13-10 17 cm 3 when these glasses are doped with Ag, Br, and Cl. It is established that halogen impurities change the concentration of U-centers most strongly by two to three orders of magnitude. Analysis of the data obtained shows that the percentage of electrically active Br and Cl impurity atoms is 1{\%}, while for Ag atoms it is 10 2 {\%}.},
