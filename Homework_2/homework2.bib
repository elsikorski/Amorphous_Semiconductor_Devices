abstract = {Temperature dependences of the drift mobilities of electrons and holes are investigated in chalcogenide-glass semiconductors with composition Se 95 As 5 , both without impurities and with the impurities Ag and Br. The data obtained indicate that the localized states that control the transport of charge carriers are U-centers, and that the change in the magnitude of the drift mobility after doping is caused by a change in the concentration of these centers. Estimates of the concentrations of positive and negatively charged intrinsic defects show that their values are similar, equalling 10 16 cm 3 in impurity-free glasses with the composition Se 95 As 5 and lying in the range 10 13-10 17 cm 3 when these glasses are doped with Ag, Br, and Cl. It is established that halogen impurities change the concentration of U-centers most strongly by two to three orders of magnitude. Analysis of the data obtained shows that the percentage of electrically active Br and Cl impurity atoms is 1{\%}, while for Ag atoms it is 10 2 {\%}.},

I–V characteristics have been measured at various fixed temperatures. These characteristics show that, at low electric fields, an ohmic behaviour is observed. However, at high electric fields (E ∼104 V/cm), the current becomes superohmic. At high fields (104 V/cm), current could be fitted to the theory of space charge limited conduction in case of uniform distribution of localized states in the mobility gap of these materials. Using the theory of SCLC for the uniform distribution of the traps, the density of localized states near Fermi level is also calculated. Density of localized states initially increases with Sb concentration till 6 at.{\%} of Sb and then decreases with further increase of Sb. This decrease is explained in terms of average coordination number.},

The nature of the states near the gap at zero temperature is discussed and especially the way the structure of the states changes for energies ranging from midgap into either band tail (Anderson transition). We then study the effect of lattice vibrations on the eigenstates, and find that electronic states near the optical gap can be strongly influenced by thermal modulation of the atomic positions. Finally, we show the structure of generalized Wannier functions for amorphous Si, which are of particular interest for efficient ab initio calculation of electronic properties and forces for first principles dynamic simulation.},
