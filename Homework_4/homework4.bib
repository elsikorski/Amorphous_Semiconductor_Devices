abstract = {Temperature dependences of the drift mobilities of electrons and holes are investigated in chalcogenide-glass semiconductors with composition Se 95 As 5 , both without impurities and with the impurities Ag and Br. The data obtained indicate that the localized states that control the transport of charge carriers are U-centers, and that the change in the magnitude of the drift mobility after doping is caused by a change in the concentration of these centers. Estimates of the concentrations of positive and negatively charged intrinsic defects show that their values are similar, equalling 10 16 cm 3 in impurity-free glasses with the composition Se 95 As 5 and lying in the range 10 13-10 17 cm 3 when these glasses are doped with Ag, Br, and Cl. It is established that halogen impurities change the concentration of U-centers most strongly by two to three orders of magnitude. Analysis of the data obtained shows that the percentage of electrically active Br and Cl impurity atoms is 1{\%}, while for Ag atoms it is 10 2 {\%}.},

	abstract = {"Preface No longer underestimated, computational science has emerged as a powerful partner to experimental and theoretical studies. Accelerated by the ever-growing power of computers and new computational methods, it is one of the fastest growing fields in science these days. Its predictive power in atomic and subatomic scales benefits all disciplines of science, and materials science is definitely one of them. Note that, for example, materials under extreme conditions such as high temperature or pressure, high radiation, on a very small scale, can be rather easily examined via the keyboard in computational materials science. Computational science has been a familiar subject in physics and chemistry, but in the materials field it was considered of secondary importance. It is now in the mainstream, and we have to catch up with the knowledge accumulated in the subject, which strongly involves physics and mathematics. Here, we are forced to deal with an obvious question: how much catch-up will be enough to cover the major topics and to perform computational works as materials researchers? Dealing with the entire field might be most desirable, but many certainly prefer to cover only the essential and necessary parts and would rather be involved in actual computational works. That is what this book is all about. As listed in the Further Readings sections in several chapters, a number of excellent and successful books are already available in this field. However, they are largely physics- or chemistry-oriented, full of theories, algorisms, and equations.

@article{Yu2001,
	abstract = {We present a model to describe electrical conductivity along the DNA double helix. In this model, DNA is considered as a one-dimensional disordered system, and electrons are transported via variable range hopping between localized states. Thermal structural fluctuations in DNA further localize electronic wave functions, giving rise to a temperature-dependent localization length. The model quantitatively explains the temperature dependence of the conductivity observed in the lambda phage DNA (l-DNA). Electron transfer and transport along DNA are important in radiation damage and repair and in biosynthesis [1-4]. Recent experiments have demonstrated long-range charge migration along the DNA double helix, indicating that DNA is a candidate for a one-dimensional (1D) molecular wire [5-7]. However, existing conductivity data of DNA are inconsistent with one another [8-10], which has been attributed to electron-bombardment-induced contaminations [11] and strong contact effects [12]. While accurate determination of absolute values of conductivity is important, characteristic temperature dependences of the conductivity often provide clues to mechanisms of transport. Recently Tran et al. used the resonant cavity technique and systematically studied conductivity and its temperature dependence along the DNA double helix [12]. It is found that at high temperatures the conductivity can be described as s {\~{}} exp2Ek B T, with E 0.15 eV for dry lambda phage DNA (l-DNA) samples and E 0.165 eV for l-DNA lyophilized in buffer samples, whereas at low temperatures the conductivity in both the dry l-DNA and the l-DNA in buffer exhibits a very weak temperature dependence. The crossover occurs at about 200-250 K. While the high temperature behavior suggests that charge transport is due to the temperature driven activation process, the underlying physics of the weak temperature dependence at low temperatures and the mechanism leading to the crossover with decreasing temperature are not yet understood. It has been speculated that at a low temperature regime the ionic conduction rather than the electronic conduction may be the primary contribution to the conductivity [12]. In this Letter, we show that the observed temperature-dependent conductivity in DNA can be consistently modeled, without invoking additional ionic conduction mechanisms, by considering that electrons may use variable range hopping for conduction and that electron localization is enhanced by strong thermal structural fluctuations in DNA. A DNA double helix with a random base pair sequence can be viewed as a 1D disordered system. In this system, the disorder leads to electronic localization, and electron hoppings between these localized "impurity" states along the chain are responsible for the conductivity. The probability for a hop from an occupied site to a vacant site separated by a distance R is approximately P exp22aR 2 Wk B T [13], where a 21 is the localization length and W is the energy difference between two sites. According to Mott's variable range hopping argument [14,15], there is competition between the two terms in the exponential, and an electron may optimize its hopping distance R to achieve the largest hopping rate. Recent charge transfer studies of DNA have shown that two competing mechanisms , unistep superexchange and multistep hopping, contribute to the charge migration [16,17], which is consistent with this variable range hopping picture. If we assume that site energy has a uniform distribution between 2D to D, the average energy spacing for sites separated by a distance R would be DaR, where a 3.4 {\AA} is the distance between the nearest neighboring bases. We have P exp ∑ 22aR 2 Da Rk B T ∏. (1) The most likely hopping distance R 0 is determined by maximizing this expression, R 0 p Da2ak B T. Accordingly , the conductivity s would be s exp2 q 8Daak B T. (2) Equation (2) characterizes variable range hopping at low temperatures, which has a weaker temperature dependence than an activated behavior. It applies provided that R 0 is larger than the distance between the nearest neighboring bases, a. If R is smaller than a, the conductivity has the usual temperature-dependence characteristic of activated behavior, s exp2Dk B T. The criterion, R 0 a, naturally gives the crossover temperature, k B T c D2aa. (3) Thus, according to the variable range hopping picture, one would expect a crossover of temperature dependence of s. Above T c , electron transport is via the nearest neighbor hopping and is a simple activation process, whereas below T c , electrons may optimize their paths by using the variable range hopping, resulting in a weaker temperature dependence. The variable range hopping and resultant temperature dependence of conductivity in 1D systems have also 6018 0031-90070186(26)6018(4){\$}15.00},

	abstract = {An insight into the present understanding of point defects in the simplest and the most radiation-resistant oxide glass, glassy silicon dioxide (silica) is presented. The defects and their generation processes in glassy and $\alpha$-quartz forms of silicon dioxide are significantly different. The only defect, confirmed to be similar in both materials, is oxygen vacancy. In silica, additional defects of dangling bond type are gener- ated from precursor sites formed by strained Si-O bonds, and by modifier ions. The optical absorption spectra of silica are dominated by paramagnetic dangling bond type defects: silicon dangling bond ("E'- center") and oxygen dangling bond ("non-bridging oxygen hole center, NBOHC"). Radiation-induced in- terstitial oxygen atoms exist in peroxy linkage (Si-O-O-Si) form, they can react with oxygen dangling bonds to create peroxy radicals or dimerize into interstitial O2 molecules. Hydrogen doping helps to re- duce the defect concentration, however, creates new precursors in the form of hydroxyl groups and may stimulate O vacancy generation. Doping by fluorine reduces the number of strained Si-O bonds and re- sults in glass, which has higher vacuum ultraviolet transparency and higher resistance to excimer laser light than pure silica. {\textcopyright}},

	abstract = {{{{A model is presented for the structure and properties of active centers in 1one-pair semiconductors, based on the possibility of unique bonding configurations which can arise from the presence of nonbonding orbitals. It is shown that the lowest-energy neutral center is unstable towards the creation of different positively and negatively charged centers, thus resulting in a negative effective correlation energy. These centers yieM gap states which explain the unusual properties of lone-pair semiconductors. Recent measurements of luminescence' and of photoinduced optical absorption and electron spin resonance' demonstrate the presence of gap states in chalcogenide materials. The absence of spin magnetism' before photoexcitation has made a chemical identification of the associated bonding configurations difficult. Anderson' has proposed a model to account for these properties based on the idea that in amorphous and vitreous materials the effective interaction between a pair of electrons in the same state can be attractive because of coupling to atoIDic motion. Street and Mott' have specialized this idea by assuming that a large density (-10" cm ') of dangling bonds in such materials act both as acceptors and donors and that atomic motion sufficiently lowers the total energy to make the effective correlation energy negative, resulting in charged centers. These charged centers in turn give rise to states in the gap and explain the principal properties of chal-cogenide glasses. The purposes of this Letter are to describe the bonding configurations that yield the relevant gap states, to show that a negative effective correlation energy is expected in crystalline as well as in disordered chalcogen-ides but not in tetrahedral materials, and to show that the presence of 10"-10" cm ' centers is plausible. Ovshinsky' suggested that interactions between lone-pair electrons' on different atoms and interactions with their local environment result in localized states in the gap of chalcogenide glasses. We utilize this concept to show that specific interactions between nonbonding orbitals give rise to unusual bonding configurations which we eall valence alternation pairs (VAP's).

The creation of such a VAP requires a relatively small energy, so that the density of VAP's in most glasses is relatively large.

	abstract = {Phase-change memory (PCM) material is the promising material system for nonvolatile-memory technology. Performance optimization of PCM device urgently requires the deeper clarification of its material “Gene”. In this study, through first-principles calculations, p-orbital-aligned atom chains are identified to play important roles in governing optoelectronic reflectivity in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5. These atom chains make the electronic state of the amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 hold strong electron-polarized components, thereby governing the optical property. The present study offers a new understanding of “Gene” for PCM materials which benefit the material design and the performance improvement of PCM devices.},
