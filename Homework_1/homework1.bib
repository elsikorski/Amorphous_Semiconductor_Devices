abstract = {Temperature dependences of the drift mobilities of electrons and holes are investigated in chalcogenide-glass semiconductors with composition Se 95 As 5 , both without impurities and with the impurities Ag and Br. The data obtained indicate that the localized states that control the transport of charge carriers are U-centers, and that the change in the magnitude of the drift mobility after doping is caused by a change in the concentration of these centers. Estimates of the concentrations of positive and negatively charged intrinsic defects show that their values are similar, equalling 10 16 cm 3 in impurity-free glasses with the composition Se 95 As 5 and lying in the range 10 13-10 17 cm 3 when these glasses are doped with Ag, Br, and Cl. It is established that halogen impurities change the concentration of U-centers most strongly by two to three orders of magnitude. Analysis of the data obtained shows that the percentage of electrically active Br and Cl impurity atoms is 1{\%}, while for Ag atoms it is 10 2 {\%}.},

	abstract = {It is pointed out that a model which agrees well with the observed properties of semi-conducting glasses is an attractive Hubbard model of localized states. Such a model has no gap for two-electron excitations but an energy gap for one-electron ones. The suggested physical model for a two-electron excitation is a new covalent bond in the structure, which is severely localized. It is also proposed that the one-electron excitation spectrum is wholly, or almost wholly, extended, and all observed gaps are identical with the mobility gap. The usually accepted models for semiconduc-tion in amorphous materials involving localized states in the gap' are deficient in two related ways: They do not come to grips with the problem of the interactions of electrons in localized states, and they do not attempt to discuss what can be argued to be the most fundamental experimental fact about these states, i.e. , their magnetic properties. In the best-attested example of localized states, impurity bands in covalent semiconductors, the localized electrons show Curie-law paramagnetism due to repulsive Cou-lomb interactions. 2 In a wide variety of other materials, especially the semiconducting glasses , paramagnetism appears to be either absent or not simply related to densities of localized states. For these no simple modif ication of the conventional model is possibl-even noninter-acting electrons must show Pauli paramagnetism if there is a Fermi level in the localized region-and I propose the following new model. I envisage a random lattice of "sites" i, which may be occupied by up-and down-spin electrons, and which have a spectrum of energies E; with density p(E;) in energy, the energy being a random function of position. These may be thought of as representing the totality of possible covalent bonds between nearby atoms in the random glass structur e. The unique feature of the model is that it is assumed to have a strong attractive Hubbard interaction -U' between up-spin (designated by 0) and down-spin (0) electrons on the same bond site i. That is, I assume that we deal with one of the great majority of all substances which are naturally diamagnetic, preferring paired electrons to single ones. This attractive interaction U' can be further modeled, if we like, as the sum of a repulsive Coulomb interaction U and an attractive interaction caused by the drawing together of the two atoms in the bond. In a Holstein model' for this attractive interaction, we can introduce a bond length coordinate x; and assume a potential energy V= 2c x-A. x;(n;i+n;{\~{}}), which, when eliminated via {\&} V/{\&}x; = 0, gives},

@techreport{Marshall1983,
	abstract = {The increasing use of amorphous semiconducting films in various commercial applications has stimulated considerable interest in the electronic transport properties of such materials. Extensive studies performed over the past decade have revealed that, whilst non-crystalline semiconductors behave in some respects similarly to their crystalline counterparts, a number of new (or previously unnoticed) characteristics may also be manifested. A particular case concerns the diffusion of drifting charge carriers, which is frequently found to be characterised by an anomalous degree of dispersion, when examined in amorphous thin films. In this review, we describe the above phenomenon of 'anomalous dispersion'. Having initially outlined the present view of band structure and carrier transport mechanisms in non-crystalline materials, we continue with a description of the experimental techniques used in the investigation of the drift velocity of excess charge carriers. Details are then provided of the various characteristics associated with both 'conventional' and 'anomalous' dispersion. Models, in which the anomalous behaviour has been associated with both hopping and trap-limited band transport, are reviewed and assessed. Although anomalous dispersion was initially investigated as a phenomenon of interest in its own right, attention has increasingly turned towards the possibility that a detailed examination of the transient behaviour may be of use in determining details of the energy distribution of localised states in disordered films. We outline the various techniques which have been suggested and examine their successes and limitations, concluding with an indication of likely future developments and directions of investigations .},

	abstract = {Studies of amorphous (a-) semiconductors have been driven by technological advances as well as fundamental theories. Observation of electrical switching, for example, fueled early interest in a-chalcogenides. More recently switching of the a-chalcogenide Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 has been applied quite successfully to DVD technology where the quest for the discovery of better-suited materials continues. Thus, switching provides researchers today with an active arena of technological as well as fundamental study. On the theoretical front, bond constraint theory-or BCT-provides a powerful framework for understanding the structure and properties of a-materials. Applications of BCT to switching in Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 holds the promise of finding the best composition suited for switching applications. This work presents EXAFS data that describe local bonding configurations in as-deposited Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5. The data show that Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 may best be viewed as a random array of Ge 2 Te 3 and Sb 2 Te 3 structural units imbedded in a tissue of aTe , 17{\%} of which is over coordinated. In addition, a valence alternation pair defect is introduced to the model to satisfy charge conservation constraints. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Phase-change materials are technologically important due to their manifold applications in data storage. Here we report on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of crystallization of the phase change material Ag4In3Sb67Te26 (AIST). We show that, at high temperature, the observed crystal growth mechanisms and crystallization speed are in good agreement with experimental data. We provide an in-depth understanding of the crystallization mechanisms at the atomic level. At temperatures below 550 K, the computed growth velocities are much higher than those obtained from time-resolved reflectivity measurements, due to large deviations in the diffusion coefficients. As a consequence of the high fragility of AIST, experimental diffusivities display a dramatic increase in activation energies and prefactors at temperatures below 550 K. This property is essential to ensure fast crystallization at high temperature and a stable amorphous state at low temperature. On the other hand, no such change in the temperature dependence of the diffusivity is observed in our simulations, down to 450 K. We also attribute this different behavior to the fragility of the system, in combination with the very fast quenching times employed in the simulations.},
