abstract = {Temperature dependences of the drift mobilities of electrons and holes are investigated in chalcogenide-glass semiconductors with composition Se 95 As 5 , both without impurities and with the impurities Ag and Br. The data obtained indicate that the localized states that control the transport of charge carriers are U-centers, and that the change in the magnitude of the drift mobility after doping is caused by a change in the concentration of these centers. Estimates of the concentrations of positive and negatively charged intrinsic defects show that their values are similar, equalling 10 16 cm 3 in impurity-free glasses with the composition Se 95 As 5 and lying in the range 10 13-10 17 cm 3 when these glasses are doped with Ag, Br, and Cl. It is established that halogen impurities change the concentration of U-centers most strongly by two to three orders of magnitude. Analysis of the data obtained shows that the percentage of electrically active Br and Cl impurity atoms is 1{\%}, while for Ag atoms it is 10 2 {\%}.},

	abstract = {"Preface No longer underestimated, computational science has emerged as a powerful partner to experimental and theoretical studies. Accelerated by the ever-growing power of computers and new computational methods, it is one of the fastest growing fields in science these days. Its predictive power in atomic and subatomic scales benefits all disciplines of science, and materials science is definitely one of them. Note that, for example, materials under extreme conditions such as high temperature or pressure, high radiation, on a very small scale, can be rather easily examined via the keyboard in computational materials science. Computational science has been a familiar subject in physics and chemistry, but in the materials field it was considered of secondary importance. It is now in the mainstream, and we have to catch up with the knowledge accumulated in the subject, which strongly involves physics and mathematics. Here, we are forced to deal with an obvious question: how much catch-up will be enough to cover the major topics and to perform computational works as materials researchers? Dealing with the entire field might be most desirable, but many certainly prefer to cover only the essential and necessary parts and would rather be involved in actual computational works. That is what this book is all about. As listed in the Further Readings sections in several chapters, a number of excellent and successful books are already available in this field. However, they are largely physics- or chemistry-oriented, full of theories, algorisms, and equations. It is quite difficult, if not impossible, for materials students to follow all those topics in detail"-- Ch. 1. Introduction -- ch. 2. Molecular dynamics -- ch. 3.

@article{Yu2001,
	abstract = {We present a model to describe electrical conductivity along the DNA double helix. In this model, DNA is considered as a one-dimensional disordered system, and electrons are transported via variable range hopping between localized states. Thermal structural fluctuations in DNA further localize electronic wave functions, giving rise to a temperature-dependent localization length. The model quantitatively explains the temperature dependence of the conductivity observed in the lambda phage DNA (l-DNA). Electron transfer and transport along DNA are important in radiation damage and repair and in biosynthesis [1-4]. Recent experiments have demonstrated long-range charge migration along the DNA double helix, indicating that DNA is a candidate for a one-dimensional (1D) molecular wire [5-7]. However, existing conductivity data of DNA are inconsistent with one another [8-10], which has been attributed to electron-bombardment-induced contaminations [11] and strong contact effects [12]. While accurate determination of absolute values of conductivity is important, characteristic temperature dependences of the conductivity often provide clues to mechanisms of transport. Recently Tran et al. used the resonant cavity technique and systematically studied conductivity and its temperature dependence along the DNA double helix [12]. It is found that at high temperatures the conductivity can be described as s {\~{}} exp2Ek B T, with E 0.15 eV for dry lambda phage DNA (l-DNA) samples and E 0.165 eV for l-DNA lyophilized in buffer samples, whereas at low temperatures the conductivity in both the dry l-DNA and the l-DNA in buffer exhibits a very weak temperature dependence. The crossover occurs at about 200-250 K. While the high temperature behavior suggests that charge transport is due to the temperature driven activation process, the underlying physics of the weak temperature dependence at low temperatures and the mechanism leading to the crossover with decreasing temperature are not yet understood. It has been speculated that at a low temperature regime the ionic conduction rather than the electronic conduction may be the primary contribution to the conductivity [12]. In this Letter, we show that the observed temperature-dependent conductivity in DNA can be consistently modeled, without invoking additional ionic conduction mechanisms, by considering that electrons may use variable range hopping for conduction and that electron localization is enhanced by strong thermal structural fluctuations in DNA. A DNA double helix with a random base pair sequence can be viewed as a 1D disordered system. In this system, the disorder leads to electronic localization, and electron hoppings between these localized "impurity" states along the chain are responsible for the conductivity. The probability for a hop from an occupied site to a vacant site separated by a distance R is approximately P exp22aR 2 Wk B T [13], where a 21 is the localization length and W is the energy difference between two sites. According to Mott's variable range hopping argument [14,15], there is competition between the two terms in the exponential, and an electron may optimize its hopping distance R to achieve the largest hopping rate. Recent charge transfer studies of DNA have shown that two competing mechanisms , unistep superexchange and multistep hopping, contribute to the charge migration [16,17], which is consistent with this variable range hopping picture. If we assume that site energy has a uniform distribution between 2D to D, the average energy spacing for sites separated by a distance R would be DaR, where a 3.4 {\AA} is the distance between the nearest neighboring bases. We have P exp ∑ 22aR 2 Da Rk B T ∏. (1) The most likely hopping distance R 0 is determined by maximizing this expression, R 0 p Da2ak B T. Accordingly , the conductivity s would be s exp2 q 8Daak B T. (2) Equation (2) characterizes variable range hopping at low temperatures, which has a weaker temperature dependence than an activated behavior. It applies provided that R 0 is larger than the distance between the nearest neighboring bases, a. If R is smaller than a, the conductivity has the usual temperature-dependence characteristic of activated behavior, s exp2Dk B T. The criterion, R 0 a, naturally gives the crossover temperature, k B T c D2aa. (3) Thus, according to the variable range hopping picture, one would expect a crossover of temperature dependence of s. Above T c , electron transport is via the nearest neighbor hopping and is a simple activation process, whereas below T c , electrons may optimize their paths by using the variable range hopping, resulting in a weaker temperature dependence. The variable range hopping and resultant temperature dependence of conductivity in 1D systems have also 6018 0031-90070186(26)6018(4){\$}15.00},

	abstract = {An insight into the present understanding of point defects in the simplest and the most radiation-resistant oxide glass, glassy silicon dioxide (silica) is presented. The defects and their generation processes in glassy and $\alpha$-quartz forms of silicon dioxide are significantly different. The only defect, confirmed to be similar in both materials, is oxygen vacancy. In silica, additional defects of dangling bond type are gener- ated from precursor sites formed by strained Si-O bonds, and by modifier ions. The optical absorption spectra of silica are dominated by paramagnetic dangling bond type defects: silicon dangling bond ("E'- center") and oxygen dangling bond ("non-bridging oxygen hole center, NBOHC"). Radiation-induced in- terstitial oxygen atoms exist in peroxy linkage (Si-O-O-Si) form, they can react with oxygen dangling bonds to create peroxy radicals or dimerize into interstitial O2 molecules. Hydrogen doping helps to re- duce the defect concentration, however, creates new precursors in the form of hydroxyl groups and may stimulate O vacancy generation. Doping by fluorine reduces the number of strained Si-O bonds and re- sults in glass, which has higher vacuum ultraviolet transparency and higher resistance to excimer laser light than pure silica. {\textcopyright}},

Here we elucidate the aging process in amorphous GeTe, a prototypical phase-change material, by advanced numerical simulations, photothermal deflection spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy experiments. We show that aging is accompanied by a progressive change of the local chemical order towards the crystalline one. Yet, the glass evolves towards a covalent amorphous network with increasing Peierls distortion, whose structural and electronic properties drift away from those of the resonantly bonded crystal. This behaviour sets phase-change materials apart from conventional glass-forming systems, which display the same local structure and bonding in both phases.},

Our approach extends molecular dynamics beyond the usual pair-potential approximation, thereby making possible the simulation of both co-valently bonded and metallic systems. In addition it permits the application of density-functional theory to much larger systems than previously feasible. The new technique is demonstrated by the calculation of some static and dynamic properties of crystalline silicon within a self-consistent pseu-dopotential framework.

MD calculations are able to predict equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of condensed systems. However, in all practical applications MD calculations have used empirical intera-tomic potentials. This approach, while appropriate for systems like the rare gases, may fail for covalent andi or metallic systems. Furthermore, these calculations convey no information about electronic properties. On the other hand, DF calculations have provided an accurate, albeit approximate, description of the chemical bond in a large variety of systems, ' but are computationally very demanding. This has so far precluded the application of DF schemes to the study of very large and/or disordered systems and to the computation of interatomic forces for MD simulations. We wish to present here a new method that is able to overcome the above difficulties and to achieve the following results: (i) compute ground-state electronic properties of large andlor disordered systems at the level of state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations ; (ii) perform ah initio MD simulations where the only assumptions are the validity of classical mechanics to describe ionic motion and the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation to separate nuclear and electronic coordinates.

The simulations were done in a microcanonical ensemble, using a pairwise potential, on systems with up to 1800 particles. Three different systems, at densities ranging from 3.0 to 3.3 g/cm3, were prepared by quenching from the melt. The network topology of our system is analyzed through partial pair correlations, coordination numbers, angle distributions, and ring statistics. A detailed analysis of the interatomic distances reveals that in the amorphous state there is a short-range order dominated by a slightly distorted (AlO4)5? tetrahedron, in agreement with recent experimental results. This conclusion is supported by the distribution of nearest-neighbor coordination numbers, where more than 75{\%} of Al atoms have four O as nearest-neighbors. Ring statistics reveal the presence of two- to fivefold rings, with a peak at the fourfold ring and where the two- and threefold rings are planar. Comparison with available experimental data and earlier calculations shows that the structures of amorphous and liquid alumina are very similar. The amorphous structure also presents close similarities to the surface structure of ? -alumina at room temperature. Simulations for systems at different densities show that the coordination number of the elementary unit increases as the density increases, suggesting that the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated forms of amorphous},

The atomic structure of this hydrated AMC consists of a distribution of Mg 2+ coordination states, predominately V-and VI-fold, and is heterogeneous due to the presence of Mg 2+ / CO 3 2-rich regions interspersed with small 'pores' of water molecules. This heterogeneity at the atomic length scale is likely to contribute to the dehydration of hydrated AMC by providing a route for water molecules to be removed.

In this study we demonstrate that local 'structural simplicity', embodied by the degree to which atomic environments within a material are similar to each other, is powerful concept for rationalising the structure of canonical amorphous material amorphous silicon (a-Si). We show, by restraining a reverse Monte Carlo refinement against pair distribution function (PDF) data to be simpler, that the simplest model consistent with the PDF is a continuous random network (CRN). A further effect of producing a simple model of a-Si is the generation of a (pseudo)gap in the electronic density of states, suggesting that structural homogeneity drives electronic homogeneity. That this method produces models of a-Si that approach the state-of-the-art without the need for chemically specific restraints (beyond the assumption of homogeneity) suggests that simplicity-based refinement approaches may allow experiment-driven structural modelling techniques to be developed for the wide variety of amorphous semiconductors with strong local order.},

	abstract = {The concept of multiscale modeling embodies the idea that a comprehensive description of a material will require an understanding over multiple time and length scales. A multiscale model requires that descriptions at all levels be consistent with each other, which can be particularly demanding for advanced materials and complex fluids. For crystalline materials, emerging modeling approaches have married small-and intermediate-scale descriptions in a highly effective manner, but challenges remain at long time and length scales. For soft materials, such as polymers or liquid crystals, modeling techniques have adopted a more or less systematic coarse-graining approach, in which atomic and molecular details are gradually blurred as one seeks to describe longer length scales. This approach presents its own brand of challenges. And, in spite of rapid advances, entire classes of materials, including amorphous glasses, foams, and gels, have resisted attempts to describe their structure and dynamics over long and relevant length and time scales. This issue of MRS Bulletin covers some areas of materials modeling in which enormous advances have been made, but which continue to raise intriguing questions and formidable challenges. wind of activity in the area of multiscale modeling and to scientific advances that even for the expert have been difficult to digest. For hard materials, available methods have matured to the point where increasingly comprehensive calculations can be performed to address subtle questions about relations between chemistry, structure, and material behavior. But among all the excitement, entire classes of materials have resisted attempts by modelers to reveal their secrets. In the particular case of soft materials (e.g., polymeric glasses and melts, biological macromolecules), widely used modeling approaches require enormous leaps of faith, and well-founded theoretical frameworks for the development of multiscale modeling strategies are only now beginning to emerge. For this issue of MRS Bulletin, we have identified five areas of materials modeling in which enormous advances have been made but which continue to raise intriguing questions and formidable challenges. These five areas are by no means comprehensive , and they represent only a thin slice of the materials modeling community. They do provide, however, a relatively broad overview of current thinking and emerging trends, and they offer a perspective on some of the developments that we might expect over the next decade. The methodology to be used for a particular problem depends on the length and time scales of interest (Figure 1). The concept of multiscale modeling embodies the idea that a comprehensive description of a material will require an understanding over multiple length and time scales. More subtle is the fact that a comprehensive , multiscale model requires that descriptions at all levels be consistent with each other. That requirement for consistency often demands that models for different processes or pieces of a problem be coupled and solved concurrently, a feat that is often sought but rarely achieved in the study of advanced materials and complex fluids. For some classes of materials, emerging modeling approaches have married small-and intermediate-scale descriptions in a highly effective manner, but challenges remain at long time and length scales. Such challenges are largely due to the computational demands associated with high-resolution calculations over such scales. For some others, modeling techniques have adopted a more or less systematic coarse-graining approach in which atomic and molecular details are gradually blurred as one seeks to describe longer length scales. In the simplest coarse-grained model, a collection of atoms is simply lumped into an individual "super atom," thereby reducing the resolution of the model but alleviating its computational demands. In more sophisticated approaches, a detailed description of a system is mapped onto a handful of carefully chosen variables that are sufficient to describe its overall behavior over long time and length scales.},
