abstract = {Aging is a ubiquitous phenomenon in glasses. In the case of phase-change materials, it leads to a drift in the electrical resistance, which hinders the development of ultrahigh density storage devices. Here we elucidate the aging process in amorphous GeTe, a prototypical phase-change material, by advanced numerical simulations, photothermal deflection spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy experiments. We show that aging is accompanied by a progressive change of the local chemical order towards the crystalline one. Yet, the glass evolves towards a covalent amorphous network with increasing Peierls distortion, whose structural and electronic properties drift away from those of the resonantly bonded crystal. This behaviour sets phase-change materials apart from conventional glass-forming systems, which display the same local structure and bonding in both phases.},

Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations, we found that the activation barrier of interstitial Xe in UN in the “kick-out” diffusion mechanism is lower than that in the direct interstitial mechanism, and the net Xe diffusion occurs with vacancies mediated; that is, once an interstitial Xe atom is trapped in a U vacancy site, it will be immobile without other uranium vacancies mediated.},

	abstract = {{{We present a unified scheme that, by combining molecular dynamics and density-functional theory, profoundly extends the range of both concepts. Our approach extends molecular dynamics beyond the usual pair-potential approximation, thereby making possible the simulation of both co-valently bonded and metallic systems. In addition it permits the application of density-functional theory to much larger systems than previously feasible. The new technique is demonstrated by the calculation of some static and dynamic properties of crystalline silicon within a self-consistent pseu-dopotential framework. PACS numbers: 71.10.+x, 65.50. +m, 71.45.Gm Electronic structure calculations based on density-functional (DF) theory' and finite-temperature computer simulations based on molecular dynamics (MD) have greatly contributed to our understanding of condensed-matter systems. MD calculations are able to predict equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of condensed systems. However, in all practical applications MD calculations have used empirical intera-tomic potentials. This approach, while appropriate for systems like the rare gases, may fail for covalent andi or metallic systems. Furthermore, these calculations convey no information about electronic properties. On the other hand, DF calculations have provided an accurate, albeit approximate, description of the chemical bond in a large variety of systems, ' but are computationally very demanding. This has so far precluded the application of DF schemes to the study of very large and/or disordered systems and to the computation of interatomic forces for MD simulations. We wish to present here a new method that is able to overcome the above difficulties and to achieve the following results: (i) compute ground-state electronic properties of large andlor disordered systems at the level of state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations ; (ii) perform ah initio MD simulations where the only assumptions are the validity of classical mechanics to describe ionic motion and the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation to separate nuclear and electronic coordinates.

	abstract = {The structural properties of amorphous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have been investigated by means of the molecular dynamics technique. The simulations were done in a microcanonical ensemble, using a pairwise potential, on systems with up to 1800 particles. Three different systems, at densities ranging from 3.0 to 3.3 g/cm3, were prepared by quenching from the melt. The network topology of our system is analyzed through partial pair correlations, coordination numbers, angle distributions, and ring statistics. A detailed analysis of the interatomic distances reveals that in the amorphous state there is a short-range order dominated by a slightly distorted (AlO4)5? tetrahedron, in agreement with recent experimental results. This conclusion is supported by the distribution of nearest-neighbor coordination numbers, where more than 75{\%} of Al atoms have four O as nearest-neighbors. Ring statistics reveal the presence of two- to fivefold rings, with a peak at the fourfold ring and where the two- and threefold rings are planar. Comparison with available experimental data and earlier calculations shows that the structures of amorphous and liquid alumina are very similar. The amorphous structure also presents close similarities to the surface structure of ? -alumina at room temperature. Simulations for systems at different densities show that the coordination number of the elementary unit increases as the density increases, suggesting that the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated forms of amorphous},

We rigorously assess the B3LYP functional for solids through calculations of lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and thermochemical properties (atomization energies and reaction energies). The theoretical lattice constants overestimate the experimental ones by approximately 1{\%}, and hence behave similarly to the PBE gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional. B3LYP atomization energies of solids are drastically worse than those of nonempirical hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functionals (HF/DFT) such as PBE0 and HSE03.

The atomic structure of this hydrated AMC consists of a distribution of Mg 2+ coordination states, predominately V-and VI-fold, and is heterogeneous due to the presence of Mg 2+ / CO 3 2-rich regions interspersed with small 'pores' of water molecules. This heterogeneity at the atomic length scale is likely to contribute to the dehydration of hydrated AMC by providing a route for water molecules to be removed. We show that this iterative methodology enables wide sampling of the potential energy landscape, which is important for elucidating the true atomic structure of highly disordered metastable materials.},

In this study we demonstrate that local 'structural simplicity', embodied by the degree to which atomic environments within a material are similar to each other, is powerful concept for rationalising the structure of canonical amorphous material amorphous silicon (a-Si). We show, by restraining a reverse Monte Carlo refinement against pair distribution function (PDF) data to be simpler, that the simplest model consistent with the PDF is a continuous random network (CRN). A further effect of producing a simple model of a-Si is the generation of a (pseudo)gap in the electronic density of states, suggesting that structural homogeneity drives electronic homogeneity. That this method produces models of a-Si that approach the state-of-the-art without the need for chemically specific restraints (beyond the assumption of homogeneity) suggests that simplicity-based refinement approaches may allow experiment-driven structural modelling techniques to be developed for the wide variety of amorphous semiconductors with strong local order.},
