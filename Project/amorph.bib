abstract = {Aging is a ubiquitous phenomenon in glasses. In the case of phase-change materials, it leads to a drift in the electrical resistance, which hinders the development of ultrahigh density storage devices. Here we elucidate the aging process in amorphous GeTe, a prototypical phase-change material, by advanced numerical simulations, photothermal deflection spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy experiments. We show that aging is accompanied by a progressive change of the local chemical order towards the crystalline one. Yet, the glass evolves towards a covalent amorphous network with increasing Peierls distortion, whose structural and electronic properties drift away from those of the resonantly bonded crystal. This behaviour sets phase-change materials apart from conventional glass-forming systems, which display the same local structure and bonding in both phases.},

	abstract = {The incorporation and diffusion behaviors of Xe in uranium mononitride (UN) have been studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. The incorporation and binding energies of Xe located at different sites are calculated. Because of strain relief related to moving Xe atom from highly strained interstitial site into the large steric vacancy site, a stronger binding energy between the incorporated Xe and the large steric vacancy forms. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations, we found that the activation barrier of interstitial Xe in UN in the “kick-out” diffusion mechanism is lower than that in the direct interstitial mechanism, and the net Xe diffusion occurs with vacancies mediated; that is, once an interstitial Xe atom is trapped in a U vacancy site, it will be immobile without other uranium vacancies mediated.},
