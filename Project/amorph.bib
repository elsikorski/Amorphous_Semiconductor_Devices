abstract = {Aging is a ubiquitous phenomenon in glasses. In the case of phase-change materials, it leads to a drift in the electrical resistance, which hinders the development of ultrahigh density storage devices. Here we elucidate the aging process in amorphous GeTe, a prototypical phase-change material, by advanced numerical simulations, photothermal deflection spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy experiments. We show that aging is accompanied by a progressive change of the local chemical order towards the crystalline one. Yet, the glass evolves towards a covalent amorphous network with increasing Peierls distortion, whose structural and electronic properties drift away from those of the resonantly bonded crystal. This behaviour sets phase-change materials apart from conventional glass-forming systems, which display the same local structure and bonding in both phases.},

	abstract = {The incorporation and diffusion behaviors of Xe in uranium mononitride (UN) have been studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. The incorporation and binding energies of Xe located at different sites are calculated. Because of strain relief related to moving Xe atom from highly strained interstitial site into the large steric vacancy site, a stronger binding energy between the incorporated Xe and the large steric vacancy forms. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations, we found that the activation barrier of interstitial Xe in UN in the “kick-out” diffusion mechanism is lower than that in the direct interstitial mechanism, and the net Xe diffusion occurs with vacancies mediated; that is, once an interstitial Xe atom is trapped in a U vacancy site, it will be immobile without other uranium vacancies mediated.},

	abstract = {{{We present a unified scheme that, by combining molecular dynamics and density-functional theory, profoundly extends the range of both concepts. Our approach extends molecular dynamics beyond the usual pair-potential approximation, thereby making possible the simulation of both co-valently bonded and metallic systems. In addition it permits the application of density-functional theory to much larger systems than previously feasible. The new technique is demonstrated by the calculation of some static and dynamic properties of crystalline silicon within a self-consistent pseu-dopotential framework. PACS numbers: 71.10.+x, 65.50. +m, 71.45.Gm Electronic structure calculations based on density-functional (DF) theory' and finite-temperature computer simulations based on molecular dynamics (MD) have greatly contributed to our understanding of condensed-matter systems. MD calculations are able to predict equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of condensed systems. However, in all practical applications MD calculations have used empirical intera-tomic potentials. This approach, while appropriate for systems like the rare gases, may fail for covalent andi or metallic systems. Furthermore, these calculations convey no information about electronic properties. On the other hand, DF calculations have provided an accurate, albeit approximate, description of the chemical bond in a large variety of systems, ' but are computationally very demanding. This has so far precluded the application of DF schemes to the study of very large and/or disordered systems and to the computation of interatomic forces for MD simulations. We wish to present here a new method that is able to overcome the above difficulties and to achieve the following results: (i) compute ground-state electronic properties of large andlor disordered systems at the level of state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations ; (ii) perform ah initio MD simulations where the only assumptions are the validity of classical mechanics to describe ionic motion and the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation to separate nuclear and electronic coordinates.
